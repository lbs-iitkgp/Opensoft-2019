The Corporation has disputed as to the number of workers under the contract labour system and their authenticity and the period of their work etc. We also make it clear that this order does not prevent the State Government to proceed in accordance with law in the matter of abolition of contract labour system. Consequently the principal employer cannot be required to order absorption of the contract labour working in the establishment concerned. In the said list, the Labour Commissioner had mentioned that about 2000 workmen had been working since last 15 years as contract labourers. It is denied that the Corporation is using the contract labour as slaves or bonded labour. The Minister for Labour of the State addressed a letter dated 4.2.1999 to the Commissioner of the Corporation recommending for abolishing the existing contract system. In the writ petition, it is also stated that the contract entered into by the Corporation with the contractors is a sham arrangement. As laid down in the Constitution Bench judgment, absorption of contract labourers cannot be automatic and it is not for the court to give such direction. For this purpose the Department uses its own staff and not contract labour. 2-33 are different contractors who had been entrusted with the above-mentioned work on contract basis.

In such cases the rule would apply and the breach itself would be prima facie proof of negligence: see Scott v. London Dock Co. (3 H. & C. 601). In case of any accident happening or being apprehended to a canal, any Divisional Canal. In relying upon this case, Mr. Viswanatha Sastri claims that s. 15 of the Canal Act covers the present facts. I shall now consider the facts as they stand in this case to discover if the canal authorities can be said to be at fault. As the width of the canal was 400 feet, the out-flow would be at the rate of 5,000X30/400 Cusecs if the breach was 30 feet wide. It has not been shown that the breach could have been caused by an act of God or an act of third party. It could not claim to be in pursuance of the Canal Act. The defendant's appeal must, therefore, be dismissed and the plaintiff's appeal allowed. The plaintiff has not led evidence to establish any particular act of negligence.

It is by virtue of this rule that the decree in the present case was passed without permitting the tenant to be heard. 37 was not applicable to a decree in ejectment in view of the provisions of The Rents Act in terms of which alone such a decree could be passed. The landlord obtained a decree in ejectment against the tenant in a suit filed under Or. 37 expressly gives power to a Court to set aside a decree passed under the provisions of that Order. This is the decree which the tenant sought to set aside. 37 to set aside the ejectment decree was made to the trial Court. Express provision is thus made for setting aside a decree passed under Or. The High Court agreed with the Courts below that no special circumstances justifying the setting aside of the decree existed. No question of setting aside the decree under that order, therefore, arises. The tenant thereafter made an application for extension of time and this was rejected on June 22, 1961. If the present contention is right, then the tenant's application was wholly incompetent. The question is, should the decree be set aside ?

Thus on the actual appointments made the total reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes would be 9 while 34 would be available for the unreserved quota. Thus by promulgating the new carry forward rule in 1915, the government of India itself cancelled the carry forward rule of 1952. The carry forward rule of 1952 was substituted by the carry forward rule of 1955. Eventually however the Union Public Service Commission recommended 45 names for appointment, 16 of which were unreserved and 29 were reserved against vacancies for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. In this view of the matter it is unnecessary to consider whether the carry forward rule of 1952 would be unConstitutional, for that rule no longer exists.

In our opinion, there must be a subsisting obligation to make the payment of refund before a person is entitled to claim a set off under s. 49E. He says that the Income-Tax Officer can decide the question whether refund is due or not when an application for refund is made to him. There is no difficulty in refuting the contention of the learned counsel for the Revenue that the refund, if due, was due under the provisions of the Act. At least, it should have made such a claim before the Income Tax Officer at the time of assessment. If a claim to refund is barred by a final order, it cannot be said that there. He further contends that the refund is not due under the Act but under the said Rules, and therefore, s. 49E does not apply.

This case appears to receive support from the evidence of Dr. (Mrs.) Iqbal Shukla who had conducted postmortem examination of the three dead bodies. On the merits, Mr. Sethi has raised some general considerations affecting the credibility of the oral evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of its case. Dr. (Mrs.) Iqbal Shukla adhered to the opinion already givenby her but Dr. Rai's evidence completely destroyed the evidence given by Dr. (Mrs.)Shukla. It is not suggested by him that the order passed by the trial Court convicting the three appellants even after acquitting Rachhpal Singh was itself invalid. It is, however, significant that none of the prosecution witnesses has referred to Gurmukh Singh attacking Anup Singh until they gave evidence in the Sessions Court. It is on the case of Gurmukh Singh that Mr. Sethi naturally concentrated, and it is to Gurmukh Singh's case that we must now turn. In that case, three persons were jointly tried with conspiring together. That infirmity is present even in the case of Balkar Singh and Amar Kaur, though Amar Kaur put the distance at 2 to 4 feet. Therefore, we are satisfied that the case of Plummer does not make the conviction of the appellants either unreasonable or illegal. That, in brief, is the prosecution case.

A wrong decision in favour of any particular party does not entitle another party to claim the benefit on the basis of the wrong decision. A wrong decision by the Government does not give a right to enforce the wrong order and claim parity or equality. It was submitted that the writ petitioners were registered before this Court's order and therefore, it cannot be said that they had registered only to overreach this Court's order. A party cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in another case direction should be given for doing another wrong. It is pointed out that though the writ petitioners were registered less than three years back, their functionaries have varied experience for long period. Committee was of the view that the three writ petitioners have not been registered for a period of three years and, therefore, were ineligible.

The MACT found that the child was not earning and, therefore, the compensation has to be assessed on the basis of notional income. Every method or mode adopted for assessing compensation has to be considered in the background of 'just" compensation which is the pivotal consideration. It has to be borne in mind that compensation for loss of limbs or life can hardly be weighed in golden scales. If MACT made a reference to the second schedule, it should have awarded the amount on the basis of the amount indicated in the schedule. In cases, where parents are claimants, relevant factor would be age of parents. In the appeal, the quantum of compensation awarded to the respondents 1 and 2 by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Delhi (in short the 'MACT') was questioned. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the quantum of compensation fixed is unrealistic. A claim petition was filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (in short the 'Act') claiming compensation. The question of assessment of compensation, therefore, becomes stiffer. What would be 'just" compensation is a vexed question. Where the deceased was a child, he was earning nothing but had a prospect to earn.

The Tribunal should issue notice to the respondents and afford them sufficient opportunity to place any further evidence which they may choose to place. The figures given at page 265 show that the percentage of deviation by weights was anywhere from 2 to 10.2 but cases of the latter kind are very few. The award in the cases of both the companies was given on February 9, 1968. 26 lakhs which the Tribunal has taken into account.

Two ground s were urged in Debu Mahato's case for invalidating the detention order. We are not concerned to consider whether the District Magistrate was justified in passing the order of detention on the strength of the material available to him. It is true that Courts cannot sit in appeal over the propriety of detention orders. The conclusion that the past conduct of the detune raises an apprehension regarding his future behavior must at least be rational.

The principal employer, the appellant, is making a claim which, if correct, will make the contractors also, principal employers liable under the Act. 75(1) (g), inter-alia, any dispute between a principal employer and an immediate employer shall also be decided by the court. The definition clauses of "immediate employer" [s. 2 (13)] and "employee" [s. 2 (9) (11)], contain the expression "on the premises of a factory" and not within it. That the appellant,, who is the principal employer has a factory where granite memorial stones are manufactured for export is beyond question. The High Court held that the appellant was the principal employer an the contractors were the immediate employers under the Act. Their factory is situated in the premises of the appellant's factory which according to the definition clause includes the precincts thereof. Such disputes include a dispute between a principal employer and an immediate employer as noticed earlier.

It will, therefore, be seen that the High Court answered the reference,as in the view expressed by it a question of law arose for its consideration. The amount involved in the appeal was a few thousand rupees; and no important question of law arises for our decision. (a) the pay of the employee and the conditions of his service, (b) the profits of the business of the year, and (c) the general practice in similar business. It is commonplace that a reference lies only on a question of law. Therefore no question of want of jurisdiction arises in this case. During the accounting year ending with March 31, 1956, the respondent had 34 employees. Apart from the merits of the case, we do not think that this is a fit case for interference in exercise of our extraordinary jurisdiction u/art. 31, 812 he paid them a bonus of Rs.10,125. He paid them a total annual salary of Rs. During the assessment year 1956-57 he claimed a deduction of the said amount from his taxable income.

The Labour Court held that the dismissal of the appellant was justified and therefore accorded approval for such dismissal. In the present case an inquiry has been held which is said to be defective in one respect and dismissal has been ordered. It appears that the order of dismissal was communicated to the appellant on May 30, and one month's wages were also tendered to him. In the present case the order of dismissal was passed by the Regional Representative on May 28, 1960 and was communicated to the appellant on May 30th. We agree with the Labour Court that in the face of the appellant's admission of the mistakes there could be no question of victimisation in this case. Learned counsel for the appellant has further raised some points which were raised on behalf of the appellant before the Labour Court. It also held that the appellant was not a protected workman. The respondent had however to justify the order of dismissal before the Labour Court in view of the defect in the inquiry. The appellant gave his reply to the chargesheet on April 26 1960 in which he admitted the mistakes that had been made. It pointed out that the appellant had admitted the two mistakes which were the basis of the charge. It, therefore, dismissed the application of the appellant unders.

The learned District judge assumed that it was the duty of jang Singh to be punctual and to find out the exact amount before he made the deposit. He reversed the finding given by the District Judge that the application made by Jang Singh did not mention any amount and the ice reported that only Rs'. On October 25, 1957, a compromise decree was passed in favour of jang Singh and he was directed to deposit Rs. Bhola Singh applied to the Court for dismissal of jang Singh's suit, and for recall of all the orders made in jang Singh's favour. The Court,, on the other hand, made an order and through its clerk prepared a challan showing the amount which was required to be deposited.

The workman said that it had been removed by the respondent for repairs while the case of the respondent was that the workman had himself removed it. The statute has however put the matter beyond doubt by expressly saying that the fencing shall be kept in position while the machine is working. As the High Court stated, there is no dispute that the spur gear wheel was a dangerous machine within the meaning of s. 21(1)(iv)(c). There is no dispute that a guard had been put over the spur gear wheel and it was a proper guard. No question of the risk not being foreseeable, therefore, arises in this case nor is this put up by way of a defence. The High Court proceeded on the assumption that it had not been proved that the workman had himself removed the guard. We should have thought that the words "shall be securely fenced" suggest that the fencing should always be there. The respondent was prosecuted under s. 92 of the Act for having failed to, comply with s. 21(1) (iv) (c). The respondent is the Manager of an oil mill. It is not contended that if it had been there, then the respondent could be said. This is a proposition which it is unnecessary to dispute in the present case.

It is true that it has also been said there that" whether a proprietor with sons has the same power is a more doubtful case." It was held that among Jats in the Rohtak District there was no unlimited power in holders of ancestral property to alienate it. This case has however not been followed in any of the subsequent decisions and in most cases its authority has been discounted. This statement makes no distinction between the cases of a man with a son and one without a son. That we think is enough to prevent us at his distance of time from reviving the view taken in that case. We have first to observe that this statement is not correct for the case of Pahlad Singh v. Sukhdev Singh , dealt with the custom in Jhajjar Tehsil. That was a case of a sonless holder. The trial Court and the High Court of Punjab in first appeal, held that there was such customary power. Furthermore, as was pointed out, this case does not refer to the earlier authorities, for example, Telu v. Chuni . This is hardly any reason for there was nothing to show that the customary power was doubtful. The appellants are the sons of Umed Singh, one of the respondents in this appeal.

No doubt, the source of the funds would be public revenue but the funds themselves belong to the Corporation and are held by it as its own property. 2 on the other, the notification will have to be regarded as conclusive on the question that the land was required for a public purpose. No material has been placed before us from which it could be deduced that the funds of the Corporation can be regarded as local funds. If, therefore, we accept the contention of the appellants on this point the terms of the proviso will be said to have been satisfied. On the other hand it has been the case of the respondents that the State Transport Corporation is not a company but a local authority. This point was apparently not taken because even before the written statement was filed a notification under s. 6 was in fact made by the State Government. In order to get out of this difficulty the learned Attorney-General argued that the State Transport Corporation is a local authority. Taking up the last point first, we may point out that no such plea was taken on behalf of the respondents in the trial court. 1962 Indlaw SC 405, the declaration as to public purpose by the Government is final except where it is a colourable exercise of power. 4 and 6 are conclusive on the question that the land was required for a public purpose.
