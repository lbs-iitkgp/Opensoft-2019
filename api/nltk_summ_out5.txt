It appears that on 15.12.1999, officers of the respondent-Corporation visited the retail outlet of the appellants. In such circumstances, we feel that the appellants should have been allowed relief by the High Court itself instead of driving them to the need of initiating arbitration proceedings. The appellants sought for a review of the order of the High Court which prayer has been refused. The appellants sent a reply raising a few objections. The appellants have filed these appeals by special leave. In all probability, the respondent-Corporation felt satisfied with the explanation furnished by the appellants. On 2.2.2000, the appellants sent a reply.

1 The standard of reasonable man is as relevant in the case of plaintiff's contributory negligence as in the case of defendant's negligence. 3.1666666666666665 22
2 The next question that arises for consideration is whether the High Court was justified in holding that there was contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. 3.0 27
3 In this factual situation, the High Court was not justified in holding that there was contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. 2.888888888888889 23
4 Negligence ordinarily means breach of a legal duty to care, but when used in the expression "contributory negligence" it does not mean breach of any duty. 2.8888888888888884 26
5 The High Court found that there was contributory negligence on the part of the appellant for two reasons. 2.805555555555556 18
6 As regards the amount of compensation due to the appellant, the High Court held that the Tribunal had seriously erred in fixing the total compensation. 2.4999999999999996 25
7 Therefore, we are of the view that the factual situation proved in this case does not show that the appellant was contributory negligent in causing the accident. 2.4166666666666665 27
8 The appellant-car driver had also pleaded that the truck driven by the second respondent was trying to overtake another car, which was going ahead of the truck. 2.3333333333333335 27

11 The High Court held that the monthly income of the appellant would have been Rs. 1.8055555555555556 15
12 We do not think that the multiplier adopted by the High Court is wrong or the amount of compensation granted for the future loss of income is inadequate. 1.8055555555555554 28
13 In the result, we allow the appeal partly and hold that the appellant is entitled to get the full amount, namely, Rs. 1.8055555555555554 22
14 As a result, the appellant, his wife and another friend, who were occupants of the car, sustained injuries. 1.8055555555555551 18
15 The claimant in a motor accident claim case is the appellant before us. 1.75 13
16 We do not think that these two reasons given by the High Court fully justify the accepted principles of contributory negligence. 1.75 21

0 The canal was admittedly in the management of the defendant and canal banks are not breached if those in management take proper care. 3.1833333333333336 23
1 The Judicial Committee held that if the act was done, as was said, under s. 15 of the Northern India Canal and Drainage Act 1873 (8 of 1873), Art. 2.9 29
2 There is no evidence to show that the flow of water in the canal was reduced from the headworks the breach occurred. 2.8333333333333335 22
3 In such cases the rule would apply and the breach itself would be prima facie proof of negligence: see Scott v. London Dock Co. (3 H. & C. 601). 2.8166666666666664 29
4 - In every such case, such Canal Officer or person shall tender compensation to the proprietors or occupiers of the said lands for all damage done to the same. 2.733333333333333 29
5 But apart from that I find nothing in the Canal Act imposing any duty on the defendant to take care of the banks. 2.6833333333333336 23

7 In relying upon this case, Mr. Viswanatha Sastri claims that s. 15 of the Canal Act covers the present facts. 2.5333333333333337 20
8 The second point urged on behalf of Government was that there was no proof of negligence whatever by the plaintiff and the plaintiff must therefore fail. 2.5 26
9 I shall now consider the facts as they stand in this case to discover if the canal authorities can be said to be at fault. 2.483333333333334 25
10 As the width of the canal was 400 feet, the out-flow would be at the rate of 5,000X30/400 Cusecs if the breach was 30 feet wide. 2.3499999999999996 26
11 It has not been shown that the breach could have been caused by an act of God or an act of third party. 2.316666666666667 23
12 It must also be remembered that what is said in relation to it in one case cannot indiscriminately be applied to another case. 2.2666666666666666 23
13 If absolute liability is to give way to fault liability, some fault must be established by evidence or must be capable of being reasonably inferred from the circumstances. 2.216666666666667 28
14 Therefore I think that the first contention of the defendant that there is no evidence of negligence must be rejected. 2.1666666666666665 20
15 It could not claim to be in pursuance of the Canal Act. 2.1166666666666667 12

17 Act or omission which can claim statutory protection or is alleged to be in pursuance of a statutory command may attract Art. 2.0666666666666664 22
18 The defendant's appeal must, therefore, be dismissed and the plaintiff's appeal allowed. 2.0333333333333337 12

14 Thus out of 48 expected vacancies, 9 would be reserved vacancies and 39 would be unreserved. 3.8431372549019605 16

In our opinion, there must be a subsisting obligation to make the payment of refund before a person is entitled to claim a set off under s. 49E. He says that the Income-Tax Officer can decide the question whether refund is due or not when an application for refund is made to him. There is no difficulty in refuting the contention of the learned counsel for the Revenue that the refund, if due, was due under the provisions of the Act. At least, it should have made such a claim before the Income Tax Officer at the time of assessment. If a claim to refund is barred by a final order, it cannot be said that there. He further contends that the refund is not due under the Act but under the said Rules, and therefore, s. 49E does not apply. Mr. Sastri contends that it is not necessary that there should be a prior adjudication to enable a person to claim set off. It must till show that a refund is due to it.

If a public servant accepts gratification for inducing any public servant to do or to forbear to do any official act, etc. But if he ceases to be a public servant by that time, the court can take cognizance of the offence without any such sanction." That authority alone would be competent to judge whether on the facts alleged, there has been an abuse or misuse of office held by the public servant. Existence thus of a valid sanction is a prerequisite to the taking of cognizance of the enumerated offences alleged to have been committed by a public servant. For instance a police officer in discharge of duty may have to use force which may be an offence for the prosecution of which the sanction may be necessary. The sanctioning authority is not required to separately specify each of the offence against the accused public servant.

S. 24 envisages the making of a statement by a person in any proceeding against the public servant for an offence u/ss.

9 The only other ground found by the Labour Court against the enquiry officer is that he made some unnecessary observations and, therefore, he was biased. 2.014705882352941 25
10 The respondent No.1 filed a writ appeal before the Division Bench contending that the preliminary order of the Labour Court in setting aside the enquiry report was illegal. 1.9705882352941178 28
11 Therefore, finding of the Labour Court that enquiry was vitiated because it was conducted by an officer of the Management cannot be sustained. 1.9558823529411766 23
12 The relevant portion of the preliminary order is as follows: "The workman challenges the validity of the enquiry. 1.7352941176470589 18
13 But, here there is a clear finding that the findings are not perverse and principles of natural justice were complied with while conducting enquiry. 1.7352941176470587 24

The learned District judge assumed that it was the duty of jang Singh to be punctual and to find out the exact amount before he made the deposit. He reversed the finding given by the District Judge that the application made by Jang Singh did not mention any amount and the ice reported that only Rs'. On October 25, 1957, a compromise decree was passed in favour of jang Singh and he was directed to deposit Rs. Bhola Singh applied to the Court for dismissal of jang Singh's suit, and for recall of all the orders made in jang Singh's favour.

He concluded "thus the deposit made was a sufficient compliance with the terms of the decree". The learned single judge of the High Court considered the case as if it was one of extension of time.

0 Does the mere fact that someone else had removed the safeguard without the knowledge, consent of connivance of the occupier or manager always provide a defence to him? 5.117647058823529 28
1 The workman said that it had been removed by the respondent for repairs while the case of the respondent was that the workman had himself removed it. 4.9411764705882355 27
2 The statute has however put the matter beyond doubt by expressly saying that the fencing shall be kept in position while the machine is working. 3.941176470588235 25
3 As the High Court stated, there is no dispute that the spur gear wheel was a dangerous machine within the meaning of s. 21(1)(iv)(c). 3.058823529411765 24
4 There is no dispute that a guard had been put over the spur gear wheel and it was a proper guard. 2.5294117647058827 21
5 Accordingly we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Courts below and convict the respondent under s. 92 for contravening the terms of S. 21(1)(iv)(c). 2.4705882352941178 28
6 It does not arise in the present case, for we find that the respondent had offered no defence whatever, whether under s. 101 or otherwise. 2.4705882352941173 25
7 No question of the risk not being foreseeable, therefore, arises in this case nor is this put up by way of a defence. 2.294117647058824 23
8 The High Court proceeded on the assumption that it had not been proved that the workman had himself removed the guard. 2.1176470588235294 21
9 The High Court then observed that s. 21(1)(iv)(c) of the Act contemplated a default and that default had to be established by the prosecution. 2.1176470588235294 24
10 A workman of the mill while greasing the spur gear wheel which was then in motion had one of his hands caught in it. 1.9411764705882355 24

13 We, therefore, think that he is liable under s. 92 of the Act for having failed to carry out the terms of s. 21(1)(iv). 1.8823529411764706 24
14 No doubt the default on the part of the person accused has to be established by the prosecution before there can be a conviction. 1.7647058823529413 24
15 The respondent is the Manager of an oil mill. 1.7647058823529411 9
16 That is the default that has happened here; the fencing was not there when the machine had been made to work. 1.6470588235294117 21
17 It is not contended that if it had been there, then the respondent could be said. 1.5882352941176472 16
18 We, therefore, think it unnecessary to notice the cases mentioned in the judgment of the High Court or discuss the principles to be deduced from them. 1.4705882352941178 26
