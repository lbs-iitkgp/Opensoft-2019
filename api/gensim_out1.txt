204. Summary of 2000_B_115.txt with and 124 words : 2.  The short question is whether the Division Bench of the High Court was justified in dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant-Board being L.P.A. No. 904 of 1996 on the ground that application for leave to appeal was not filed. 4.  Only on this short ground, therefore, it must be held that the Division Bench of the High Court wrongly disposed of the appeal as not maintainable because the appellant had not sought any leave to appeal. Letters Patent Appeal No. 904 of 1996 is restored to the file of the High Court with a request to the appropriate Division Bench to which the appeal will be assigned for hearing, to decide the same on merits after hearing the parties concerned.

207. Summary of 2000_R_188.txt with and 88 words : It is on these grounds, the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Rent Controller. Aggrieved, the landlord filed a revision petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the High Court. The High Court without giving any reason dismissed the revision petition of the landlord. In this case, we find that no reason has been recorded by the High Court while dismissing the revision petition and this in itself is sufficient ground to set aside the judgment under appeal.

210. Summary of 2000_N_112.txt with and 122 words : The High Court in appeal set aside the findings recorded by the trial court by holding that the appellant had violated the warranty clause, as, at the relevant time, watch and ward was not present in the vessel in question. Every condition which obligates any party to perform or not to perform any act under any clause of the contract has to be so interpreted as to cover such act which normally could be expected from such person to perform.In the case of high wind with rains, rough weather at the sea, when the vessel is strongly anchored, a watch and ward in the vessel could be expected to continue up to a time when his own safety is not in doubt.

It is rather surprising that the NCTE, though it had earlier insisted in its letter dated 13.6.97 (referred to in the order of the High Court dated 5.11.98) that the NOC from the State and University were necessary, it permitted 80 more students on the basis of the additional 8 ad hoc lecturers selection.

Respondent who is the partner has been made an accused. We are not disposed to deal with all those contentions, for, it is open to the respondent to raise such contentions in the trial Court.

As the present proceedings will also have a direct linkage with the question of reinstatement and back wages, pursuant to the aforesaid award, it would be appropriate to direct that the remanded writ petition of the appellant, pursuant to the present order may be heard along with Writ Petition No. 9202 of 2000, filed by respondent No. 1 and which is pending in the High Court.

Police, Patna (Bihar) we do not see any reasonable prospect of the trial against the appellant registering substantial progress in the future.

222. Summary of 2000_S_472.txt with and 121 words : The appellants challenge to this concurrent finding is twofold: first he says that the eyewitness account of his complicity was not credible; second, that even if one were to accept the eye witness evidence of the event, he could not have been convicted under Section 302 IPC as the death of Arjun Singh was in fact caused by renal failure, septicemia and respiratory failure. On the third ground, we find that there was sufficient evidence to show that Arjun Singh was accompanied by some persons not only at Kaul but also at Kaithal and at the PGI, Chandigarh and, as correctly held by the High Court, it would be unreasonable to expect the doctors to name the persons accompanying the patients.
