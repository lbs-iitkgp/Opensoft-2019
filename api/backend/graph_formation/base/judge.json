The judgment quotes a passage from William Dalrymple's book 'The Last Mughal' about how the Red Fort at Delhi was vandalized by the British and how the damages of the colonial times are perpetuated by the Archaeological Survey Of India . One fails to see how the Red Fort, the maintenance of which the Government of Andhra Pradesh is not even remotely connected with, comes into all this. The reference to the plight of the Red Fort is followed by the observation that the ancient monuments and archaeological sites in Andhra Pradesh too are in no better state. In this way the Court declares that the agencies and the people entrusted with the responsibility to preserve and maintain the country's historical heritage are quite incapable and inefficient in the discharge of the responsibility. But once again we fail to see the relevance of all this to the simple issue before the Court. Unfortunately this is not the only incongruity. The judgment makes, at more than one place, highly caustic comments about Government Officers, especially the members of the Central Civil Service, which in the facts and circumstances of the case appear to us to be completely uncalled for.",

The material facts lie in a small compass and they are as follows. For the assessment year 1947-48 the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 142 of 1963 filed a return of her income before the Income-tax Officer, District IV, Calcutta, and the assessment was completed sometime in 1948 as a result whereof it was found that no tax was payable by her. on April 2, 1956, the Income-tax Officer served on her a notice dated March 19, 1956, under s. 34(7) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, hereinafter called the Act, on the ground of escaped assessment. The date of the notice fell within 8 years from the end of the relevant assessment year i.e., March 31, 1948; but it was served beyond 8 years from that date and, therefore, was clearly out of time under the provisions of the said section.",

        "S.K. DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from a decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal at Bombay dated November 23, 1955. The Baroda Borough Municipality is the appellant, and the respondents are the workmen employed in the electricity department of the said Municipality represented mostly by the Baroda State Electric Workers Union (hereinafter called the respondent Union). The substantial question for determination in this appeal is if the respondents, workers in a municipal department engaged in the generation, supply and sale of electric energy, are entitled to the bonus claimed out of the surplus earnings of the said department  after allowing for all outgoings including necessary expenditure of the department and deductions for all prior, charges. The question is, a short one, but has an importance and consequences reaching beyond the limits of the particular case in which it has arisen.",

In the present case, the appeal which was filed by the Respondents (herein) arises out of the Judgment and decree passed by the Addl. Distict Judge, Jaipur on 23.1.1996 in a suit filed on 19.12.1976. Therefore, the appeal which was filed before the High Court against the judgment and decree passed on 23.1.1996 by the Addl. District Judge, Jaipur, will not be governed by this Act. By sub-section (5) of Section 7, a special provision has been made that on pending suit or proceeding or appeal or review or revision, the Act will not be applicable. In the case of Syed Inamul Hag Shah 2000 Indlaw RAJ 200 (supra), the learned Single Judge only considered the effect of Section 85 but did not examine the effect of sub- section (5) of Section 7 and, on the basis of section 85, it was held that all the proceedings which were pending before the Civil Court, the Civil Court will have no jurisdiction. With great respect, perhaps the attention of the learned Single Judge was not drawn to sub-section (5) of Section 7 which specifically provides an exception that this will not be applicable to the pending suits, appeals and revisions. It has purpose behind it that when Act was made prospective, how can it operate retrospectively; therefore, all pending matters were taken out from purview of this Act.",

Abdul Rahim & Co.( 1965 (2) SCR 12.). The assessee-firm was the Managing Agents of Palani Andavar Mills Ltd., Udamalpet. It was originally constituted by a deed of partnership, dated June 1, 1934. The following 6 persons were the partners  (1) G. Venkataswami Naidu As. 2 (2) G. T. Narayanaswamy Naidu As. 2 (3) G. T. Krishnaswamy Naidu As. 2 (4) M. A. Palaniappa Chettiar As. 5 (5) R. Guruswamy Naidu As. 2 1/2 (6) K. Venkatasubba Naidu As. 21 By subsequent transactions the share of G. Venkataswami Naidu was transferred to his son Vidyasagar and the share of M. A. Palaniappa Chettiar was purchased by R. Guruswamy Naidu. With the result that the 5th partner, G. Guruswamy, had 7 1/2 annas share in the partnership instead of 2 1/2 annas share which he held earlier. Guruswamy Naidu and Venkatasubba Naidu, the 5th and 6th partners, belonged to a Hindu undivided family and the beneficial interest of their shares belonged to that family; indeed, during the previous years the joint family was assessed in respect of the income pertaining to the said shares. On August 24, 1950, the said Hindu undivided family was divided and a partition deed was executed between the members thereof. Under the deed the ten annas share held by the family was divided as follows : (1) R. Guruswamy Naidu As.2 (2) Rudrappa  Anna 1 (3) Venkataramana  Anna 1 (4) Subba Naidu As. 2 (5) Venkatasubba Naidu As. 1-4 (6) Rudrappa Naidu As. 1-4 (7) Jagannatha Naidu As. 1-4 After the said partition, on November 30, 1950, a new pertner-ship deed was executed between the partners of the assessee-firm.",

The Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala had held that the limitation to lay the suit started to the appellants on January 1, 1968 when the High Court had earlier delivered the judgment quashing the assessment of agricultural income tax upon the estate of Raja Mananikraman and his estate is liable only to the extent of 1/693 share of that estate. The facts are not in dispute. The agricultural Income Tax Officer has made an assessment of the agricultural income tax to the tune of Rs.84,788.78 for the period between 1.11.1956 to 31.3.1958. It is not necessary to dilate all the facts but suffice to state that for recovery thereof when demand was made, the succeeding Raja made payment in part discharging their liability. On October 12, 1960 a sum of Rs.18069.75 was paid and another successor on December 23, 1960 paid a sum of Rs.21,000/-. As stated earlier, ultimately in O.P. No.2413/65 by judgment and order dated January 1, 1968, the High Court set aside the assessment and the liability to recover the tax was confined only to the extent of 1/693 share of the estate Raja Mana vikraman.",

It appears from the judgment of the Tribunal that the matter was argued without reference to facts which are now stated in the special leave petition, namely, that the vessel was built in India and excise duty was paid thereon at the time of its clearance. It was delivered to an Indian party. The contention on these facts is that this was not a transaction of export and import which would render the appellants liable to the payment of customs duty.",

It is also alleged that subsequently on 29.5.1959, Ramadhar himself as well as on behalf of his brother, who was then a minor, executed sale deed in respect of the said property for a consideration of Rs. 665. It is not disputed that the said sale-deed was not registered. Subsequently, respondent No. 7 transferred the aforesaid property in favour of the plaintiff-appellant herein by a registered sale deed for a consideration of Rs. 1,200. It appears that after the sale deed was executed, there arose a dispute in regard to possession of the property, and proceeding under Section 145 of Code of Criminal Procedure was taken between the parties. Thereafter defendant-respondents 1-6 filed a suit for specific performance of agreement for sale dated 29.5.1959, which subsequently was registered as Suit No. 52A of 1972. The trial court decided other issues in favour of the plaintiff but dismissed the suit on the ground of limitation. No appeal thereafter was preferred against the said decree. After some time, the plaintiff-appellant herein filed a suit for possession of the property in dispute. In the said suit, defendant-respondents 1-6 filed written statement wherein they defended their possession on the basis of unregistered sale-deed dated 29.5.1959. Respondent No. 7, owner of the property, also filed a separate written statement. Several issues were framed in the said suit and one of the issues was as to whether the sale-deed dated 29.5.1959 was executed by Ramadhar or not. The trial court was of the view that the signature of Ramadhar on the sale-deed is fraudulent. In that view of the matter, the very basis of the defendant-respondent's case was knocked off. Consequently, the suit was decreed. Aggrieved, defendant-respondents 1-6 preferred an appeal before the first appellate court. The first appellate court, without considering the question as to whether the signature of Ramadhar on the unregistered sale-deed dated 29.5.1959 was genuine or not, allowed the appeal of the respondents and set aside the decree of the trial court. The plaintiff thereafter preferred second appeal before the High Court, which was dismissed. It is against the said judgment ; the plaintiff-appellant is in appeal before us.",

        "GAJENDRAGADKAR C. J.- The writ petition from which this appeal by special leave arises had been filed by the appellant Bisheshwar Dayal Sinha by which he challenged the validity of the order issued by the Vice-Chancellor of the Bihar University directing the reconstitution of the Govern- ing Body of the Rajendra College, Chapra, and of the rele- vant new statutes framed by him under which the said order is purported to have been issued. His case was that the relevant new statutes are ultra vires the authority of the Vice-Chan- cellor and the impugned order passed by him in pursuance of the said relevant statutes is, therefore, illegal, inoperative and void. Along with the petition filed by the appellant, four other petitions had been filed by other persons seeking to obtain similar relief. The Patna High Court has, in substance, , rejected the appellant's case and has accordingly dismissed the appellant's writ petition as well as the other petitions filed by other persons. On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Setalvad has contended that the view taken by the Patna High Court about the validity of the relevant statutes is not sustainable and that the said statutes are ultra vires with the inevitable consequence that the impugned order directing the reconstitution of the Governing Body of the Rajendra College must also be held to be invalid.",

At present we are not deposed to go into this broad question as urged by the learned Attorney General. However, it is correct to this extent that long delay in delivery of judgment gives rise to unnecessary speculations in the mind of parties to a case. Moreover, the appellants whose appeals have been dismissed by the High Court may have the apprehension that the arguments raised at the bar have not been reflected or appreciated while dictating the judgment nearly after five years. This is fairly not disputed by learned senior counsel, Shri K. Parasaran, appearing for respondent No. 1. We, therefore, on this short question, set aside the judgment under appeal without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and remit the case to the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh, on merits. In view of the fact, that the matter has been pending for a considerable period of time, we request the High Court to decide the matter expeditiously, if possible, within six months.",

It said that there was no doubt that coal being an essential commodity the State Government was within its powers to ensure that it was not misused or its availability at a fair price was not put in jeopardy. Since brick kiln owners were only consumers of coal and not dealers, all the provisions that were applicable to dealers, particularly those with respect to movement, sale, price, etc. could not be made applicable to brick kiln owners as bricks were not an essential commodity. It was, however, open to the State Government to make adequate provisions for ensuring that the coal issued for the purpose either under a permit or otherwise was not misused, but those provisions had to be made separately with this sole objective in view. the said Order insofar as it regulated the distribution, import, export and price, etc. of coal was severable as regards its application to brick kiln owners who manufactured bricks with the aid of slack coal. That being so, the said Order was not struck down in its entirety but was allowed to continue to apply to coal dealers and to regulate other matters relating to the supply and availability of coal.",

        " \"15. In Indian law deposit of patta has been held to constitute a valid equitable mortgage, though patta is not in itself a deed of title, but is only an evidence of title. This Court has consistently taken the view that the main object of tender of patta is merely to give information of the land revenue payable and the details of the property and that the exact weight to be given to the patta would depend upon the circumstances of the case. In Dohganna v. Jammanna, AIR 1931 Mad 613 1931 Indlaw MAD 228 it is pointed out that in case of pattas in respect of a land in Zamindari, if the land be at the disposal of the landlord at the time of granting the patta, prima facie such patta would not be mere bill of rent but something more and that if it is not so it would not create any rights in the pattadar in derogation of the rights of a person who would be entitled to the land subject to the proper and regular payment of rent. The question directly arose before a Bench of this Court in Official Assignee v. Basudevadoss, AIR 1925 Mad 723 1924 Indlaw MAD 205, as to whether a deposit of patta is enough to constitute an equitable mortgage. The Bench answered the question in the affirmative. Srinivasa Aiyangar, J. who delivered the leading judgment in that case, has pointed out that the answer to the question as to whether the pattas in respect of a land is a document which would be sufficient, by being deposited, to evidence the intention required for an equitable mortgage would vary according to the conditions of the country and the consciousness on the part of the members of the community and that though a patta is not a document of title still a deposit of the same with intent to create an equitable mortgage would create an equitable mortgage.\"",

Learned Judge noted that the writ petitioner i.e, the present respondent No.2 had expressed her readiness to surrender the remaining portion of the land since she also preferred to have an Industrial Training Institute in the locality and her claim for exemption of 55 cents of land just on the side of the road was required to be enquired into by the District Collector. This contention was accepted by the learned Judge by its judgment dated 02nd July 1993 and in the penultimate paragraph of the said judgment learned judge directed that till final decision is taken in Ext.P.3 (written objections) the writ petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the disputed land. It was further pointed out by Shri Poti, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants , that the final decision on the objections was taken by the authorities on 19th January 1994 when the District collector forwarded the objections with recommendation to the Board of Revenue. Therefore, the period from 02nd July 1993 when the learned Single Judge delivered the judgment till at least 18th January 1994 amounting to almost six months ought to be excluded under Explanation I to Section 6 of the Act for computing the period of one year for issuance of the Section 6 notification.",

A dispute arose between the appellant and its workmen as to payment of bonus for the years 1957-58 and 1958-59, and was referred for adjudication to the tribunal. The respondents claimed bonus on two grounds (i) on the basis of profits earned by the appellant, and (ii) on the basis that payment of some bonus at Christmas had become an implied condition of ser- vice between the appellant and its workmen. It may be men- tioned that the claim was for four months' wages for each year on the basis of profit bonus. The alternative claim was for 1 1/2 months' wages for each year on the basis of an implied term of service. We may also mention that the appellant had paid two months' basic salary as bonus for the year 1957-58, and one month's basic pay as bonus for the year 1958-59. The appellant contended that there was no surplus available on the basis of the Full Bench formula applied in such cases and therefore no profit bonus could be paid. It also contended that no bonus was payable as an implied term of service.",

        "the respondent by filing a writ petition in the High Court of U.P. at Allahabad. The principal plea raised on behalf of the respondent was that the complaints against her were false and politically motivated as respondent did not belong to the same political party as was ruling the State and that the preliminary inquiry held under Rule 4 was the foundation of the impugned order which inquiry the respondent being an Adhyaksh. could have been held only by District Magistrate and not by an Additional District Magistrate, and therefore, the inquiry was a nullity having been held by an officer not competent to hold the same, ami hence, irrelevant to serve as foundation for the impugned order The High Court In its impinged judgement dated 11.9.1998 delivered In a Division Bench directed the impunged order to be quashed holding the preliminary enquiry conducted by an Additional District Magistrate to be incompetent and vitiated. The submission made on behalf of the State that District Magistrate included an Additional District Magistrate, and therefore an inquiry held b> an Additional District Magistrate could not be said to be incompetent, was rejected. On 19.11.1998 the State filed this petition seeking special leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. Subsequently, leave was granted and the petition was converted into a Civil Appeal. The respondent was noticed and has vehemently opposed the appeal.",

No.3012/79 are sufficient for disposal of the appeals. On July 11, 1956, he Government had granted to the appellant certain parcels of land for settling down colonies thereon and to cultivate the land on improved methods of cultivation, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the grant made under the Government Grants Act, 1895. Under s.10(2) of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 (for short 'the Act'), notice was issued on October 20, 1974 by the prescribed authority calling upon him to submit the return for determination of the ceiling area. The appellant's objections raised on December 4, 1975 were rejected by the Prescribed Authority by proceedings dated February 28, 1975 holding that the appellant held 94 Bighas 16 Biswas of surplus land and was called upon to surrender the same. The appellant carried the matter in appeal to the appellate authority and the Civil Judge by judgment dated June 2, 1976 dismissed the appeal. In the writ petitions, as stated earlier, the High Court confirmed the orders of the authorities under the Act.",

We have perused the reasons given by the learned Judges for not referring the matter to a larger Bench. We are not satisfied that the said reasons justified their deciding the matter and not referring it to the larger Bench. In the circumstances, we are unable to uphold the impugned judgment of the High Court insofar as it relates to the matter of inter se seniority of the Judicial Officers impleaded as respondents in the writ petition. The impugned judgment of the High Court insofar as it relates to the matter of seniority of the respondent Judicial Officers is set aside. The appeals are disposed of accordingly. No costs.",

On 23-3-1983, the High Court ordered that the special suit filed by the Bank against the private limited company before the court of the Civil Judge stood transferred to the High Court. On 2-7-1984,the appellants brought to the notice of the court in which their appeal against the ejectment decree was pending the aforesaid facts and prayed that the hearing of the appeal be stayed or reasonable time granted to obtain orders from the Official Liquidator. In reply to the appellants'application the Bank stated that the Official Liquidator had filed an application in the High Court in the winding-up petition aforementioned whereon the High Court had passed an order and transferred all pending proceedings in the court of the Civil Judge, in respect of the suit filed by the Bank against the private limited company to the High Court. The Bank, therefore, supported the appellants' prayer that the hearing of the appeal should be stayed until appropriate orders were received from the High Court. This application was not separately dealt with but was taken notice of in the judgment delivered in the appeal on 9-10-1984. The judgment stated that it appeared that some liquidation proceedings had been taken at Bombay and that sufficient time had been given to the appellants to obtain orders from the High Court or the Official Liquidator but, in spite thereof, nothing had been done.",
